# Sales_P
In this project I have taken the data from a company called bigmart.
I have carefully cleaned and categorized the data in a way it made the most sense to me.
I visualized the data by plotting it into different graphs and making relations betwwen different features.

# Objective
The main goal of the project was to predict the future sales for all the items by observing and training on previous data.

# Conclusion
I used many models like regression, randomforest and boosting models.
The one which gave me the best outcome was XGBoosting.
This project helped me in understanding feature engineering as well as best approaches to tackle a regression problem.
