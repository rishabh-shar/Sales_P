# Sales_P
In this project I have taken the data from a company called bigmart.
I have carefully cleaned and categorized the data in a way it made the most sense to me.
I visualized the data by plotting it into different graphs and making relations betwwen different features.

# Conclusion
I used many models like regression, randomforest and boosting models.
The one which gave me the best outcome was XGBoosting.
